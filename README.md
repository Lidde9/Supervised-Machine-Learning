 Predicting Heart Failures (Project #5)
 
This project is in supervised ML classification, where several models are evaluated and hypertuned to as accurately predict heart failures. The project practices on workflow using machine learning models (including data cleaning, preprocessing, test/train split, gridsearching, hyperparameter evaluation, final evaluation). The work is done through scikit learn libraries. 

This project uses supervised ML classification models to answer the following questions:
- Can we predict Heart Failures accurately with classification machine learning?
- How can we minimize the risk that we miss potential high risk heart attack patients (recall)?
- How do we reduce costs of early warning (reduce features needed)?
